# Minesweepers-Sesnors-Arduino
These are the codes used during the competition Minesweepers '18. The microcontroller used is Arduino Uno. Two Arduinos were used, one for sensors which sends data serially to a shielded one an Ethernet shield for wireless data communication with the control station. 
The sketch has tabs for saparating different functions to read from sensors like:
1.) Metal detector.
2.) Temprature sesnor.
3.) Two ultrasonic sensors for detecting above ground mines.
4.) An encoder.
The GUI used is LabVIEW. (Not included here)
